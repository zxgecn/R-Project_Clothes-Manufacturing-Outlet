Background and Objective

A high-end fashion retail store is looking to expand its products. It wants to understand the market and find the current trends in the industry. It has a database of all products with attributes, such as style, material, season, and the sales of the products over a period of two months.

1. Analysis Tasks
To automate the process of recommendations, the store needs to analyze the given attributes of the product, like the style, season, etc., and come up with a model to predict the recommendation of products (in binary output â€“ 0 or 1) accordingly.

2. Analysis Tasks
In order to stock the inventory, the store wants to analyze the sales data and predict the trend of total sales for each dress for an extended period of three or more alternative days.

3. Analysis Tasks
To decide the pricing for various upcoming clothes, the store wishes to find how the style, season, and material affect the sales of a dress and if the style of the dress is more influential than its price

    Firstly, calculate the total sales per dress ID and save it along with the Attribute DataSet file (with column name as Total.Sales). We need to find how style,     season, and material affect the sale of a dress. Since they are categorical, let us first use the analysis of variances to see if the different types make an impact.  

    Secondly, to check if style is more influential than the price, let us construct a linear regression model as before, with only the attributes style and price.  

4. Analysis Tasks
Also, to increase the sales, the management wants to analyze the attributes of dresses and find which are the leading factors affecting the sales of a dress.

5. Analysis Tasks
To regularize the rating procedure and find its efficiency, the store wants to find if the rating of the dress affects the total sales.
